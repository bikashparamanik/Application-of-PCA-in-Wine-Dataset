# Application-of-PCA-in-Wine-Dataset 
 PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that can be used to simplify and visualize high-dimensional data. Here i showed how PCA can be used to identify the most important features in the wine dataset and to cluster the data into different types of wine. I applied PCA to the wine dataset and reduced the dimensionality from 13 to 2 dimensions. I then visualized the data in 2D and identified the clusters of wine. The results showed that the three types of wine (red, yellow and green) were well-separated in the 2D space. This suggests that PCA can be used to cluster wine based on its chemical composition.
